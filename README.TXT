Two games I made during my senior year of high school, from the months of
January to May 2012.

The first game Land Ho, is an action platformer which included a scrolling
screen which allowed for me to make very large levels, included basic 
animations, though a couple models are left unfinished.

The second game in this applet is Zombies in Space, a top down dual stick 
(without the sticks) shooter, included 6 different guns each with very 
different ways of shooting. This game was made during a weekend right after I 
learned how to make applets. 

These two games are merged into one applet as I was experimenting with menus 
at the time of making Land Ho.

All music included in this game is not in any way owned by me, 
rights go to Bastion's Soundtrack and Family Guy.
